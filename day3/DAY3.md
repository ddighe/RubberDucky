# Reverse shells day 3cd day3!!!


use ncat -lvp $port to receive and send information, there is a way to encrypt traffic, but I have not yet. Changing the ip and port is easy, and convenient. 

There are a lot of ways improve this: encrypted transmission being the largest, and multiple os support too. I will get these up and running soon.
